# The-Secret-Auction-Program-
Welcome to the Secret Auction Program! This Python script allows multiple users to place bids in a secret auction, ensuring a fair and private bidding process. The program collects each participant's name and bid amount, clears the console to maintain secrecy, and finally determines the highest bidder to announce the winner.
